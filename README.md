# pet-boarding-and-grooming-business-App
This is an application designed to facilitate the check-in and check-out process of pets in a boarding facility. 
The application has two main functionalities - the ability to check in pets and the ability to check out pets.

The check-in process involves determining whether the pet is a dog or a cat and checking for available boarding space. 
The application has 30 spaces for dogs and 12 spaces for cats, and the number of available spaces can be adjusted as the business grows. 
If there is space available for a new pet, the application collects the necessary information, 
including the length of the stay and whether the pet owner wants the pet to be groomed. 
Only dogs can be groomed, and this service is only available for pets staying for two or more days. 
The application assigns the pet to a specific space.

The check-out process involves identifying the pet and its boarding space and determining whether there is a grooming fee. 
Again, grooming is only available for dogs staying for two or more days. 
The application then calculates the total fees based on a predefined table and marks the boarding space as vacant.

It is a user-friendly application that simplifies the process of boarding pets. 
With its efficient check-in and check-out functionalities, it helps businesses manage their pet boarding services effectively, 
ensuring customer satisfaction and a positive experience for both pets and their owners.
